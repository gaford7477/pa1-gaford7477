# Quadratic-eq
 problem:
 Finding X values when you cannot factor the function
 user:
 Jack Reichmann, roommate
 Reference:
 Stewart, James. Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals. 8th ed., Cengage Learning, 2014
 Design:
 You must have a function that can not be factored
 the equation is x=(-b+/-(b^2-4ac))/2a
 you take the b from y=Ax^2+Bx+C, and plug it into the equation
 take the a from the equation, and plug it in
 take the c from the equation, and plug it in
 these variables will be the input
 the value given from plugging the input variables in, will give you your output
 the output, which will be two numbers, will be your X values.
 Application:
 Inputs are A, B, and C
 Output is the X- Value
 #Equation: x^2+4x+3
 A= 1
 B= 4
 C= 3
 plug into quadratic equation
 x=(-4+/-(4^2-4(1)(3))/2(1)
 output is x= -1, x=-3
 x values are -1, and -3.
